I have always been very connected to technology, after all, I was born in the decade when the population began to have access to computers and the internet. I got to know the technology area, more precisely, Web Development, in 2014 when I started my BS in Systems Analysis. I worked in other areas and it wasn't until 2022 that I got back to working with HTML & CSS to make some minor edits on a small business website I was operating. What I thought would be a few minor edits turned into love for programming",

A lot of programming logic was used to define a maximum number of attempts, letters already used and letters that were guessed from the word, the game's score, and finally the import of a database of words in JSON. The useCallback hook was used to monitor the JSON file data preventing rendering and through a loop, transform the data into two objects containing a word and a random category.",
