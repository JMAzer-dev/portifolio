            My name is Jo√£o Marcos A. Azeredo, I was born in 1993 in the city of
            Rio de Janeiro - RJ. I have always been very connected to
            technology, after all, I was born in the decade when the population
            began to have access to computers and the internet. I got to know
            the technology area, more precisely, Web Development, in 2014 when I
            started my BS in Systems Analysis. I worked in other areas and it
            wasn't until 2022 that I got back to working with HTML & CSS to make
            some minor edits on a small business website I was operating. What I
            thought would be a few minor edits turned into love for programming
